## 🚀 Project Overview

EventHive is a mini-project designed as a centralized, user-friendly platform to streamline event and community management within a college campus. It aims to replace fragmented communication and manual processes with an intuitive web interface, enhancing engagement and coordination among students, faculty, and administrators. This repository currently contains the **frontend implementation** of the admin/management portal.

## 🤔 Problem Statement

Traditional campus event management often suffers from:

*   🤯 **Fragmented Information:** Event details scattered across emails, social media, and notice boards.
*   ⏳ **Manual Processes:** Inefficient event approvals, venue bookings, and membership tracking.
*   📉 **Low Engagement:** Difficulty for students to discover events and communities.
*   🚧 **Communication Gaps:** Lack of a unified platform for announcements and feedback.
*   👥 **Lack of Centralization:** No single source of truth for community activities and memberships.

EventHive aims to solve these issues by providing a structured, visually appealing, and accessible platform.

## ✨ Key Features (Admin Portal Frontend)

*   👤 **Role-Based Interface:** Designed for administrators and community leads.
*   🗓️ **Event Management:** Create, view upcoming/past events, and manage event details.
*   👥 **Community Management:** View community details (About, Core Team, Contact).
*   🙋 **Membership Approval:** Interface for viewing and managing pending membership requests.
*   📊 **Member Listing:** View and manage current community members.
*   📢 **Announcements:** Dedicated section for viewing and managing announcements (UI).
*   📝 **Feedback System:** Interface to view feedback submitted for events.
*   🎨 **Intuitive UI/UX:** Clean design, smooth navigation, and interactive elements designed in Figma and built with React.
*   📱 **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for accessibility.
